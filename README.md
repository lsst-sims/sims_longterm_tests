# sims_longterm_tests
Test ground for long-term simulation generation

(cloned at /sdf/data/rubin/shared/fbs_sims/)

Baseline simulation - copy of baseline from v4.3.1 

Weather simulations - copy of baseline from v4.3.1

Plots - 
* vector metric Nvisits (Nvisits per filter + all filters) over time, for each simulation


Chimera simuations - 
a weather simulation up to date X, then baseline simulation after date X

Continuing simulations - 
a weather simulation up to date X, then continue simulation using baseline configuration
